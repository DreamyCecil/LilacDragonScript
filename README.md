# Lilac Dragon Script

*"If it doesn't do its job, it's willing to jump off a sky island."*

A custom scripting language interpreter based on [YellowAfterlife's interpreter tutorials](https://yal.cc/interpreters-guide/).
Uses [Dreamy Structures](https://github.com/DreamyCecil/DreamyStructures) in its base.

Consists of a parser-tokenizer, an AST tree builder and a custom bytecode compiler.

*[Work in progress]*
